# The Flash Card

This is an application that allows ukrainians to learn English words. 
The csv file consists of the 1000 most popular english words, which are shown one at a time in random order. If the card shows a word you don't know, then it adds it to the  another csv. The card also shows the translation of the word into Ukrainian after a while.
